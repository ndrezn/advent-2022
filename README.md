# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

A couple other folks at Plotly are doing this this year... so... why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
